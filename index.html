		      We show that the Chow covectors of a linkage matching field define a bijection between certain degree vectors and lattice points, and we demonstrate how one can recover the linkage matching field from this bijection.
  This resolves two open questions from Sturmfels and Zelevinsky (1993) on linkage matching fields. For this, we give an explicit construction that associates a bipartite incidence graph of an ordered partition of a common set to each lattice point in a dilated simplex.
  Given a triangulation of a product of two simplices encoded by a set of spanning trees on a bipartite node set, we similarly prove that the bijection from left to right degree vectors of the trees is enough to recover the triangulation. As additional results, we show a cryptomorphic description of linkage matching fields and characterise the flip graph of a linkage matching field in terms of its prodsimplicial flag complex. Finally, we relate our findings to transversal matroids through the tropical Stiefel map.

In this paper we develop a combinatorial abstraction of tropical linear programming. This generalizes the search for a feasible point of a system of min-plus-inequalities. We obtain an algorithm based on an axiomatic approach to this generalization. It builds on the introduction of signed tropical matroids based on the polyhedral properties of triangulations of the product of two simplices and the combinatorics of the associated set of bipartite graphs with an additional sign information. Finally, we establish an upper bound for our feasibility algorithm applied to a system of min-plus-inequalities in terms of the secondary fan of a product of two simplices. The appropriate complexity measure is a shortest integer vector in a cone of the secondary fan associated to the system.

		      We present an algorithm to compute all n nondominated points of a multicriteria discrete optimization problem with d objectives using at most O(n^(\lfloor d/2 \rfloor)) scalarizations. The method is similar to algorithms by Przybylski, Gandibleux, and Ehrgott and by Klamroth, Lacour, and Vanderpooten with the same complexity. As a difference, our method employs a tropical convex hull computation, and it exploits a particular kind of duality which is special for the tropical cones arising. This duality can be seen as a generalization of the Alexander duality of monomial ideals.

	      This paper is about the combinatorics of finite point configurations in the tropical projective space or, dually, of arrangements of finitely many tropical hyperplanes. Moreover, arrangements of finitely many tropical halfspaces can be considered via coarsenings of the resulting polyhedral decompositions of R^d. This leads to natural cell decompositions of the tropical projective space TP_min^(d-1). Our method is to employ a known class of ordinary convex polyhedra naturally associated with weighted digraphs. This way we can relate to and use results from combinatorics and optimization. One outcome is the solution of a conjecture of Develin and Yu (2007).

	    <div id="AbstractBVIPG" style="display:none"> <br><b>Abstract</b>
	      Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the breakthrough result of Calude et al. (2017). The central combinatorial object underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwiński et al. (2019). By providing a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of universal trees, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all existing approaches to attain polynomial runtime. This is due to the existence of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion of the tree.
	      
	      As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in the universal tree. Value iteration - asymptotically the fastest known algorithm for parity games - is a repeated application of operators associated with arcs in the game graph to obtain the least fixed point. Our main technical contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of operators associated with arcs in a strategy subgraph. This is achieved via a careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees. By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi&nacute;ski and Lazi&cacute; (2017), or the Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (2020), we obtain instantiations of the general framework that take time O(mn^2log nlog d) and O(mn^2log^3 nlog d) respectively per iteration.

	    <div id="AbstractCCVM" style="display:none"> <br><b>Abstract</b>
	      We characterize a rich class of valuated matroids, called R-minor valuated matroids that includes the indicator functions of matroids, and is closed under operations such as taking minors, duality, and induction by network. We refute the refinement of a 2003 conjecture by Frank, exhibiting valuated matroids that are not R-minor. The family of counterexamples is based on sparse paving matroids. Valuated matroids are inherently related to gross substitute valuations in mathematical economics. By the same token we refute the Matroid Based Valuation Conjecture by Ostrovsky and Paes Leme (Theoretical Economics 2015) asserting that every gross substitute valuation arises from weighted matroid rank functions by repeated applications of merge and endowment operations. Our result also has implications in the context of Lorentzian polynomials: it reveals the limitations of known construction operations.

	    <div id="AbstractPOM" style="display:none"> <br><b>Abstract</b>
	      In a previous work, we gave a construction of (not necessarily realizable) oriented matroids from a triangulation of a product of two simplices. In this follow-up paper, we use a variant of Viro's patchworking to derive a topological representation of the oriented matroid directly from the polyhedral structure of the triangulation, hence finding a combinatorial manifestation of patchworking besides tropical algebraic geometry. We achieve this by rephrasing the patchworking procedure as a controlled cell merging process, guided by the structure of tropical oriented matroids. A key insight is a new promising technique to show that the final cell complex is regular.

	    <div id="AbstractOMTPS" style="display:none"> <br><b>Abstract</b>
	      We introduce a construction of oriented matroids from a triangulation of a product of two simplices. For this, we use the structure of such a triangulation in terms of polyhedral matching fields. The oriented matroid is composed of compatible chirotopes on the cells in a matroid subdivision of the hypersimplex, which might be of independent interest. In particular, we generalize this using the language of matroids over hyperfields, which gives a new approach to construct matroids over hyperfields. A recurring theme in our work is that various tropical constructions can be extended beyond tropicalization with new formulations and proof methods.

	      B&aacute;r&aacute;ny's colorful generalization of Carath&eacute;odory's Theorem combines geometrical and combinatorial constraints. Kalai-Meshulam (2005) and Holmsen (2016) generalized B&aacute;r&aacute;ny's theorem by replacing color classes with matroid constraints. In this note, we obtain corresponding results in tropical convexity, generalizing the tropical colorful Carath&eacute;odory Theorem of Gaubert-Meunier (2010). Our proof is inspired by geometric arguments and is reminiscent of matroid intersection. In particular, we show that the topological approach fails in this setting. We also discuss tropical colorful linear programming and show that it is NP-complete. We end with thoughts and questions on generalizations to polymatroids, anti-matroids as well as examples and matroid simplicial depth.

<div id="AbstractThesis" style="display:none"> <br><b>Abstract</b>
	    The main topic of this work is the study of systems of inequalities where only the operations 'min' and '+' are used and which we call tropical linear inequality systems. An important algorithmic problem is to determine a point which fulfills all the inequalities. This problem, referred as the tropical feasibility problem, occurs in connection with scheduling as well as mean payoff games. It is analogous with the classical feasibility problem for linear inequality systems.

We study these systems by means of sets of bipartite graphs. Methods from combinatorial optimization yield a characterization of these bipartite graphs, referred as covector graphs, in terms of minimal matchings.

We start with a thorough investigation of polyhedra, which are naturally associated to shortest paths in weighted directed graphs.

It leads to new covector decompositions of the tropical projective space. We reveal the connection with order polytopes and the boundary of the tropical projective space. Furthermore, we resolve a conjecture of Develin and Yu (2007).

A second approach to examine tropical linear inequality systems arises by representing them as images of linear inequality systems over Puiseux series under a valuation map. We introduce the subfield of Puiseux fractions which is suitable for computations on a computer in contrast to Puiseux series, and we relate linear inequality systems over Puiseux fractions with linear inequality systems over the real numbers.

Combining these ideas from classical halfspace arrangements with the covector decompositions leads to an abstraction in terms of signed tropical matroids which are an analogue of classical oriented matroids. This allows us to study tropical linear inequality systems with tools for polyhedral subdivisions. While tropical linear inequality systems correspond to regular subdivisions of subpolytopes of the product of two simplices, our arguments readily apply to not necessarily regular subdivisions as well. We design an algorithm to determine the feasibility of a tropical linear inequality system which also works for the generalized structure derived from not necessarily regular subdivisions.

For regular subdivisions, the complexity is bounded by the entries of a minimal integer vector in a cone of the secondary fan of the product of two simplices.
